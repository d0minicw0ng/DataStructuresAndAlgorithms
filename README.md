# Common Data Structures and Algorithms

My plan is to implement common data structures and algorithms in Java as a practice. I also hope this can be 
a useful material for anyone who wants to learn/refresh very basic data structures and algorithms.

### Sorting
- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort

### Search
- Binary Search

### Data Structures
- Array
- Ordered Array
- Linked List
- Doubly Linked List
- Array Stack
- Linked List Stack
- Array Queue
- LinkedListQueue
- Double Ended Queue
- Two Stacks (Implementation of two stacks using one array)

### Common Problems
##### String
- determine whether a string has unique characters
- determine whether two strings are anagrams 


### Problems 

1. My Java isn't great because I have very limited experience in Java. Do let me know what I am doing wrong
in terms of the implementation and the Java specific things.

2. My goal is not to implement the complete data structures, but to only implement some of the common methods.
However, there will be methods that I am missing and you can also let me know if you think I am missing something.
